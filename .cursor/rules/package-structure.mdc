# Package Structure and Organization

## Package Architecture

- Each package is self-contained with its own `__init__.py`
- Packages can be imported: `from packages.static_analysis import Scanner`
- Main scripts delegate to package modules, not the reverse
- Each package has a main entry script (e.g., `packages/static-analysis/scanner.py`)
- Packages expose classes/functions via `__init__.py`
- Packages are independent and can be used standalone

## Package Locations

- `packages/static-analysis/`: Static analysis scanners (Semgrep, CodeQL)
- `packages/fuzzing/`: Binary fuzzing with AFL++
- `packages/web/`: Web scanning and crawling
- `packages/llm_analysis/`: LLM-powered vulnerability analysis
- `packages/codeql/`: CodeQL-specific analysis tools
- `packages/autonomous/`: Autonomous agent components
- `packages/binary_analysis/`: Binary analysis and crash analysis
- `packages/recon/`: Reconnaissance tools
- `packages/sca/`: Software composition analysis

## Import Patterns

```python
# Absolute imports from project root
from core.config import RaptorConfig
from core.logging import get_logger
from packages.static_analysis import Scanner
from packages.llm_analysis.llm.client import LLMClient
```

## Package Structure Example

```
packages/
  package_name/
    __init__.py          # Exports public API
    main_script.py       # Entry point for package
    module1.py           # Package modules
    module2.py
```
